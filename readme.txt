Exercise log for tracking time and distance based exercise, such as walking or running.

== Description ==

Walking Log is a WordPress plugin for tracking time and distance based exercise, such as walking or hiking. 
The plugin allows you to track date, exercise time in minutes, distance, type (e.g. walking), and location.

The log is view only for visitors, and editable for users with "manage options" permissions.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'walking-log' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a page, or identify an existing page, that will be used to host the log
1. Add this short code to the page: [wrs_walking_log view="main"]
1. Add a custom field to the page with a name of wrs_walking_log (along with any value). This is required so 
   the plugin can load itself only on pages where it's needed.
1. Add new exercise types and locations using the Walking Log admin pages.
